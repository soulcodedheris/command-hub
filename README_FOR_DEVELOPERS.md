# CommandHub Developer Guide

## Welcome to CommandHub Development

Welcome, developer! This README is your comprehensive guide to understanding, contributing to, and scaling CommandHub. Whether you're onboarding for the first time or a core contributor, this document will help you navigate the philosophy, architecture, and best practices that make CommandHub a world-class platform.

---

## 🌟 Project Philosophy

CommandHub is not just a project management tool—it's a mission control system for modern organizations. Our philosophy is rooted in:

- **Machine Builder Mindset**: We don't just solve problems; we build systems that solve categories of problems for everyone.
- **Scalability by Design**: Every feature, process, and integration should scale from 5 to 5,000 users.
- **Clarity and Automation**: Reduce manual work, increase transparency, and automate wherever possible.
- **Developer Empowerment**: Make it easy for any developer to contribute, understand, and extend the platform.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### High-Level Structure

- **Frontend**: React (TypeScript), Redux Toolkit, Material-UI, Chart.js
- **Backend**: Firebase (Firestore, Auth, Storage, Cloud Functions)
- **Integrations**: WhatsApp, Asana, Keeper, Slack, SendGrid
- **DevOps**: GitHub Actions, Firebase Hosting, CI/CD

### Key Architectural Principles

- **Component Reusability**: Build atomic, composable UI components.
- **State Management**: Use Redux Toolkit for predictable, scalable state.
- **Real-Time Data**: Leverage Firestore and Socket.io for live updates.
- **API-First**: All business logic should be accessible via RESTful APIs.
- **Security by Default**: Enforce RBAC, secure API keys, and follow least-privilege principles.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+)
- Yarn or npm
- Firebase CLI
- Git
- Access to project Firebase credentials (ask a maintainer)

### 2. Setup

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/your-org/commandhub.git
cd commandhub

# Install dependencies
yarn install # or npm install

# Configure Firebase
cp .env.example .env
# Fill in your Firebase keys and other secrets in .env

# Start the development server
yarn start # or npm start
```

## 🧑‍💻 Contribution Guidelines

### How to Contribute

1. **Fork the repo** and create a feature branch (`feature/your-feature`)
2. **Write clear, maintainable code** (see Code Style below)
3. **Add/Update tests** for your feature or bugfix
4. **Document your changes** in code and, if needed, in the docs
5. **Open a Pull Request** with a clear description and context
6. **Participate in code review** and address feedback promptly

### Code Review Process

- All PRs require at least one approval from a core maintainer
- Automated checks (lint, tests, build) must pass before merging
- Use clear commit messages (see below)

### Commit Message Convention

- `feat: Add new dashboard widget`
- `fix: Resolve bug in project health calculation`
- `docs: Update API usage section`
- `refactor: Simplify state management in ProjectCard`
- `test: Add tests for analytics engine`

---

## 🎨 Code Style & Best Practices

- **TypeScript**: Use strict types everywhere. Avoid `any` unless absolutely necessary.
- **Functional Components**: Prefer function components and React hooks.
- **Atomic Design**: Build small, reusable components before composing larger ones.
- **State Management**: Use Redux slices for global state, React context for cross-cutting concerns.
- **API Calls**: Centralize in `src/api/` and use async/await.
- **Error Handling**: Always handle errors gracefully and provide user feedback.
- **Testing**: Write unit and integration tests for all logic and components.
- **Documentation**: JSDoc for functions, comments for complex logic, and update relevant markdown files.

---

## 🧪 Testing

### Tools

- **Jest**: Unit and integration tests
- **React Testing Library**: Component and UI tests
- **Cypress**: End-to-end (E2E) tests

### Running Tests

```bash
yarn test # or npm test
# For E2E
yarn cypress open
```

### Test Coverage

- All new features must have tests
- Aim for >90% coverage on core modules
- Use `yarn test --coverage` to check

---

## 🛠️ Deployment

### Environments

- **Development**: Local machine, `.env` config
- **Staging**: Firebase Hosting, preview branch
- **Production**: Firebase Hosting, main branch

### CI/CD Pipeline

- All pushes trigger lint, test, and build checks
- PRs to `main` auto-deploy to staging
- Merges to `main` auto-deploy to production
- Rollback available via Firebase Hosting

---

## 🧩 Integrations & Extensibility

- **Adding a New Integration**: Use the `src/integrations/` directory. Follow the interface contract and document usage.
- **API Extensions**: All new endpoints must be documented in `src/api/docs/`.
- **Webhooks**: Register new webhooks in the integration config and test thoroughly.

---

## 🛡️ Security & Compliance

- **Secrets**: Never commit secrets. Use `.env` and Firebase Secret Manager.
- **RBAC**: Use role-based access for all sensitive operations.
- **Data Privacy**: Follow GDPR and local data laws. Anonymize data where possible.
- **Audit Logging**: All critical actions must be logged.

---

## 🧰 Troubleshooting & Support

### Common Issues

- **Build Fails**: Check Node version, dependencies, and `.env` config.
- **Firebase Errors**: Ensure correct credentials and permissions.
- **Integration Failures**: Check API keys, network, and logs.
- **UI Bugs**: Use React DevTools and Redux DevTools for debugging.

### Getting Help

- Check the `/docs` directory for guides
- Ask in the team Slack or Discord
- Open an issue on GitHub with detailed steps to reproduce

---

## 📚 Living Documentation

- This README is a living document. Update it with every major change.
- Use `/docs` for deep dives (architecture, API, onboarding, etc.)
- Add code comments and JSDoc for all exported functions

---

## 🏆 Developer Best Practices

- **Think in Systems**: Don't just fix bugs—ask if the system can be improved.
- **Automate**: If you do something twice, automate it.
- **Document**: If it's not obvious, document it.
- **Refactor**: Leave code better than you found it.
- **Test**: Every feature, every time.
- **Review**: Give and receive feedback with respect and clarity.
- **Own**: Take responsibility for your code and its impact.
