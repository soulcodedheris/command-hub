- `documentation` - Documentation improvements
- `bug` - Bugs that need fixing
- `enhancement` - New features and improvements

#### Suggest New Ideas

- **Feature requests**: Use the [Feature Request template](https://github.com/your-org/commandhub/issues/new?template=feature_request.md)

### 2. Set Up Your Development Environment

Follow the setup instructions in [README_FOR_DEVELOPERS.md](README_FOR_DEVELOPERS.md) to get your local development environment running.

### 3. Create a Branch

```bash
# Create a new branch for your work
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
# or
git checkout -b docs/your-documentation-update
```

**Branch Naming Convention:**

- `feature/` - New features
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `docs/` - Documentation updates
- `test/` - Test improvements
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring
- `chore/` - Maintenance tasks

### 4. Make Your Changes

- **Write clear, maintainable code** (see Code Standards below)
- **Add tests** for new functionality
- **Update documentation** as needed
- **Follow the existing code style** and patterns

### 5. Test Your Changes

```bash
# Run the test suite
yarn test

# Run linting
yarn lint

# Run type checking
yarn type-check

# Run end-to-end tests (if applicable)
yarn cypress:run
```

### 6. Commit Your Changes

Use clear, descriptive commit messages:

```bash
# Good commit messages
git commit -m "feat: Add project health scoring algorithm"
git commit -m "fix: Resolve authentication token refresh issue"
git commit -m "docs: Update API documentation for new endpoints"
git commit -m "test: Add unit tests for analytics engine"

# Avoid vague messages like:
# git commit -m "fix stuff"
# git commit -m "update"
# git commit -m "wip"
```

### 7. Push and Create a Pull Request

```bash
# Push your branch
git push origin feature/your-feature-name

# Create a Pull Request on GitHub
```

### 8. Pull Request Guidelines

#### PR Title

Use the same format as commit messages:

```
feat: Add project health scoring algorithm
fix: Resolve authentication token refresh issue
docs: Update API documentation for new endpoints
```

#### PR Description

Use the provided template and include:

**What does this PR do?**
